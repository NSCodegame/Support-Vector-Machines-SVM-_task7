# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Detection with SVM  
> _"Using the power of math to detect what matters most — early diagnosis."_

Welcome to a complete, end-to-end machine learning project focused on solving a life-impacting problem: **early detection of breast cancer**. In this repository, we use the power of **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** — both linear and non-linear — to build a robust classifier that distinguishes between **malignant and benign tumors** using real-world diagnostic data.

This repository is ideal for:
- 🧑‍💻 Machine learning beginners who want to explore classification tasks  
- 🎓 Students looking to build impressive ML portfolios  
- 🧠 Data science enthusiasts who want to understand model interpretability  
- ❤️ Healthcare analysts exploring predictive modeling techniques

## 🧠 Project Overview

Breast cancer accounts for a large percentage of cancer-related deaths in women globally. Timely and accurate detection of breast cancer significantly improves survival rates. However, diagnostic processes are often prone to **subjective errors**, especially when based solely on visual examination of medical images.

This project tackles that challenge using a **machine learning-based diagnostic system** that:
- Ingests real-world data from medical diagnostics
- Trains classification models using **Support Vector Machines**
- Visually demonstrates how different kernels behave in separating data
- Compares model performance with tuned vs untuned parameters

🎯 **Goal**: Build an interpretable and performant classifier to aid in early breast cancer diagnosis using just two features (`radius_mean`, `texture_mean`) for simplicity and visualization.

## 📁 Dataset

This project uses the well-known [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### 📊 Dataset Summary:
- 🔢 **Number of instances**: 569
- 📌 **Features**: 30 real-valued input features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass
- 🎯 **Target column**: `diagnosis`
  - `M` → Malignant
  - `B` → Benign

### 🔍 Selected Features for this Project:
For clear 2D visualization and decision boundary plotting, we selected:
- `radius_mean`: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
- `texture_mean`: Standard deviation of gray-scale values

These two features provide a simple but effective subset of the data to demonstrate SVM capabilities.

## 🔍 Workflow and Methodology

This project follows a clear, modular workflow that reflects how real-world ML projects are structured:

### 1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**

* Load the dataset from CSV
* Encode the `diagnosis` labels to binary values (`M` → 1, `B` → 0)
* Select relevant features for modeling
* Scale the data using `StandardScaler`

### 2. **Model Training**

* Train two SVM models:

  * `SVC(kernel='linear')`
  * `SVC(kernel='rbf')`
* Fit each model on the training set

### 3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

* Use `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal combination of `C` and `gamma` for the RBF model
* Tune for performance using 5-fold cross-validation

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**

* Accuracy score
* Confusion matrix
* Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
* Cross-validation score

### 5. **Visualization**

* Plot 2D decision boundaries for both linear and RBF SVMs
* Save plots in `/images` for use in documentation

## 📊 Results & Observations

* ✅ **RBF Kernel** significantly outperforms Linear SVM when parameters are properly tuned.
* 🔍 **Cross-validation accuracy** was consistently high (>95%) with tuned RBF kernel.
* 🎯 Decision boundaries generated by SVMs clearly delineate the malignant and benign clusters when scaled properly.
* ⚖️ Tradeoff between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting) is well-handled by hyperparameter tuning.

> These results highlight the importance of model selection, feature scaling, and parameter tuning in real-world classification tasks.
